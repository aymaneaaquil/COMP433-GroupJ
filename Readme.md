# **Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning**

## **üìã Project Overview**
This project aims to develop an AI-powered skin cancer detection system using deep learning. By classifying dermoscopic images of skin lesions as benign or malignant, the model supports early detection and assists healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses. The project leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and metadata feature selection to enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

## **üéØ Motivation**
Skin cancer, especially melanoma, is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection significantly increases survival rates, but current diagnostic methods rely heavily on expert dermatologists, making the process time-consuming and prone to human error. This project seeks to address these limitations by automating skin lesion classification using deep learning.
